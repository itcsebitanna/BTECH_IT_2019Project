# CRIME DATA ANALYSIS AND PREDICTING VICTIMS USING MACHINE LEARNING
We have data for crime . The task is to build models to predict the crime rate based on demographic and economic information about the particular locality. 

Decision Trees
Here, we use  clean dataset to predict whether the crime rate in a locality is greater than 0.1 per capita or not.

Linear Classification
Here, GaussianNB and Linear SVC to learn classifier to predict highCrime, and compare the results for both.
	
Regression
Here, Linear and ridgeCV regression to predict highCrime, and compare the results for both.

Dirty Data
Here ,we repeat the decision tree learning for the full (non-clean) data set and present the results. We compare different missing value treatment methods as well.
