/**
 * DetectHaar applies a Haar cascade at multiple locations and multiple scales
 * to an input Gray8Image. The result is a mask with the masked (non-Byte.MIN_VALUE)
 * locations indicating the areas where the feature was detected.<br>
 * The Haar cascade is applied at multiple scales, starting with the coarsest scale,
 * and working down to the finest scale. At each scale, the cascade is applied to
 * subimages spread across the image. If the cascade detects a feature, the area of
 * the mask corresponding to that subimage is set to Byte.MAX_VALUE. When a subimage
 * is to be tested, the mask is first examined to see if the central pixel in the
 * mask area corresponding to that subimage is masked. If it is, the subimage is 
 * skipped. When transitioning to a finer scale, the mask is stretched to the new
 * size. This results in areas where features have been detected at a coarser scale
 * not being re-searched at a finer scale.<br>
 * Gray8DetectHaarMultiScale is structured as a pipeline stage so push'ing an image
 * results in a new mask being available on getFront. The mask can be further processed
 * by doing connected component detection to determine the feature characteristics,
 * or the mask can be displayed in an overlay on the original image to show the
 * feature areas.
