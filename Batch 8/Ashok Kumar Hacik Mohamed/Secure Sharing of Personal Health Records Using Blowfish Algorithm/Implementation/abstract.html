<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The widespread acceptance of cloud based services in the healthcare sector has
 resulted in cost effective and convenient exchange of Personal Health Records (PHRs)
 among several participating entities of the e-Health systems. Nevertheless, storing 
 the confidential health information to cloud servers is susceptible to revelation or 
 theft and calls for the development of methodologies that ensure the privacy of the
 PHRs. Therefore, we propose a methodology called SeSPHR for secure sharing of the PHRs
 in the cloud. The SeSPHR scheme ensures patient-centric control on the PHRs and 
 preserves the confidentiality of the PHRs. The patients store the encrypted PHRs on
 the un-trusted cloud servers and selectively grant access to different types of users 
 on different portions of the PHRs. A semi-trusted proxy called Setup and Re-encryption 
 Server (SRS) is introduced to set up the public/private key pairs and to produce the 
 re-encryption keys. Moreover, the methodology is secure against insider threats and also 
 enforces a forward and backward access control. Furthermore, we formally analyze and 
 verify the working of SeSPHR methodology through the High Level Petri Nets (HLPN). 
 Performance evaluation regarding time consumption indicates that the SeSPHR methodology 
 has potential to be employed for securely sharing the PHRs in the cloud.</p>
